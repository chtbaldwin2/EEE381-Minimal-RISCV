# A Minimal RISC-V Design using SystemVerilog

Completed as part of the EEE481 Individual Research Project in my third year at the University of Sheffield.

The design will require a testbench to feed data into the processor. The testbench can be changed to allow for memory.
If you have any questions about this project or would like to use a bit of it in your own design please contact me!
